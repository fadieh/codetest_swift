TEST

I wasn't able to complete the task at hand but I have come out of it with more Swift knowledge and will be making an effort over the weekend to finish this for my own learning. I am reassured that Swift is already becoming a great passion of mine reinforced by the hours trying to learn about Optionals and trying to convert JSON objects to strings.

LEARNING OUTCOMES

- Http networking with the Alamofire library.
- Experience with downloading JSON in Swift.
- Playing with the searchBarSearchButtonClicked method.
- Exposure to Swift Optionals.
- 

LIBRARIES USED

- Alamofire

BRIEF

I was able to fetch the data from the server by implementing a request from the server using Alamofire. I then used Swift Optionals to return the data as a String. Unfortunately, trying to figure out how to successfully use Swift Optionals meant I couldn't send data back to the server to retrieve the offers. If I had gotten over this stumbling block then I would have worked initially to save the data as strings which I could then insert into an array of parameters to send back to the server to retrieve the offers using Alamofire, using the ResponseJSON method within the library to capture the response back similar to the Get request before. 

I wasn't able to populate any Table Views unfortunately however my initial thought is that I would of been using the ScrollViewDidLoad method by turning the offers payload into an array and matching data into a specific cell by calling the index of the array inside cellForRowAtIndexPath.

If I had more time, I would of made my ViewController lighter to make the code feel less clanky and more amendable. I realised quickly that it it is a different experience compared to Objective-C to slim down your view controller. Also I would of loved to have been Unit Testing as Test Driven Development has been drilled in my head ever since day one of learning to code.
